Hello! こんにちは! مرحبا! My name is Leen Bou Alia. 
I am majoring in Operations Research and Financial Engineering and am looking forward to create some passion projects and become a better programmer.
This account is meant to keep track of some of the projects/ideas and come across. 
My favorite language is Java and I am interested in mathematics and finance.
